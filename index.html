    <p>As part of a solo project for the Finance and Economics Club at IIT Guwahati, I conducted a comprehensive fundamental analysis of various publicly listed companies, including Cipla Limited, MRF Limited, and ITC Limited. Using financial statements, ratio analysis, and industry trends, I evaluated the performance and growth prospects of these companies.<br>

        <br><br>Key Highlights:
        <ul>
            <li>Cipla Limited: Analyzed growth in earnings, revenue, and return on equity. Based on metrics such as earnings per share (EPS) growth and sustainability ratings, I assigned a stock rating of 4/5.</li>
            <li>MRF Limited: Reviewed the company's dominant position in the Indian tyre market, evaluating its revenue growth, EPS forecast, and return on equity, resulting in a stock rating of 4/5.</li>
            <li>ITC Limited: Studied ITC’s diversified portfolio in the FMCG sector, with a focus on its brand portfolio and future prospects in the Indian consumer market, leading to a stock rating of 4/5.</li>
        </ul>
            This project allowed me to apply fundamental analysis techniques and develop insights into the financial health and potential of companies across different industries.
        <br><br>
    
        Tools Used: Ratio Analysis, Financial Report Review, Market Trend Analysis.<br><br>
        
        Skills Gained: Financial Analysis, Critical Thinking, Stock Rating, Research, Industry Evaluation.</p>

    <p>
        In this project, I developed a Grocery Store Management System to streamline the process of managing customer orders and product inventory for a grocery store. The system features an intuitive user interface where store managers can manage customer orders and product details efficiently.<br><br>

Key Features:<br><br>
<ul>

<li>Order Management: Users can create, view, and manage orders, including details such as the order number, customer name, date, and total cost.</li>
<li>Product Management: The system allows for easy addition, removal, and updating of products within the store’s inventory.</li>
<li>Dashboard: Provides an overview of the order history with sortable fields like date, order number, and total cost, ensuring smooth operations.</li>
</ul><br>
The system was built with a focus on ease of use and efficiency, enhancing productivity for store management by automating routine tasks.<br><br>

Technologies Used: Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), Backend (Python/Flask), Database (SQLite/MySQL).<br><br>

Skills Gained: Full-Stack Development, Database Management, UI/UX Design, Order and Inventory Management Systems.<br><br>
