    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am Rajat Goyal, a dedicated and versatile Computer Science Engineering student at Chandigarh Engineering College, with a parallel pursuit of a B.S. in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in programming, web technologies, and data analysis, which I have applied in various real-world projects.<br><br>

        I have hands-on experience in Python programming, full-stack web development (Flask, MySQL, MongoDB), and data science tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. One of my key projects includes developing a Grocery Store Management System that streamlines sales and purchase management for store owners. I also completed a Sales Analysis project, where I leveraged data-driven insights to enhance business strategies and improve customer experiences.<br><br>
        
        During my industrial training at Grazitti Interactive, I honed my skills in backend development and database management, further solidifying my technical expertise. In addition to my technical capabilities, I have held leadership roles, such as being a Class Representative and a core team member for the Smart India Hackathon.<br><br>
        
        I am passionate about solving complex problems, optimizing workflows, and learning new technologies to drive meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>
